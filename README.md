###### **"Orewa _Kaizokuo_ ni naru otoko da!"**

I am **Nisarg**, a Junior at the [Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee](https://iitr.ac.in/) pursuing an Integrated Masters of Science in **Applied Mathematics**. I am also a **Developer** at the [Information Management Group](https://channeli.in/maintainer_site/) since my freshman year. I am passionate about Mathematics and Technology in general because of its impact on human life. Hence I am curious to know and learn everything I can in these fields.

My primary interests include FullStack Development, Anime, Manga, Chess, and Instrumental Music. My favorite characters include **Monkey D. Luffy**, Batman, Sherlock, Naruto, and Harvey Specter.

I am **[@nisarg73](https://linkedin.com/in/nisarg73/)** on almost each social media (Except Facebook), ping me up if you want to talk about anything in general!
